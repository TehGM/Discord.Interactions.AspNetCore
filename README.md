This is a simple library designed for ASP.NET Core which helps with enabling interactions (slash/application commands) in ASP.NET Core applications.

> Please note that this library is primarily designed for personal use, and therefore might not support all required features. I do not guarantee full stability, especially if library is used in a way it's not intended to - I can however confirm that it works, as I use it for my own projects. Feel free to [contribute](#contributing) if needed.
